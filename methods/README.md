# intensification/methods
This directory contains some functions and classes used throughout the scripts in `intensification`. 

From the perspective of the [manuscript](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.25322796v1), the only part of this library used directly is `neighborhood_sir.py`. The other scripts illustrate data processing workflows used to make the processed outputs in `../_data/`, but the raw data needed to run them is *not* included. They're here in this repository for reference purposes only, in case they help others apply these models and ideas to their own work.
